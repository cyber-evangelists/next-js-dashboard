## Features

- **Technology Stack**: This dashboard was built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, combining the power of a versatile React framework with a sleek and responsive CSS framework.

- **Development**: To start development locally, run the development server with the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    After running the development server, you can preview your changes by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

- **Customization**: Feel free to explore and customize the dashboard to meet your specific needs. You can modify components and pages in the `app` directory, and the page will automatically update as you make changes.

- **Font Optimization**: This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
