# Next.js Dashboard with Tailwind CSS

Welcome to my Next.js dashboard project! This project was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) boilerplate. It combines the power of Next.js with the elegance of Tailwind CSS to create a stunning and responsive dashboard.
